#Project 3
## Performance Analysis

In the previous project, the rotation transformation of an image was slow and limited by the hardware. Here we used performance counters to determine how many cycle are required on average to transform one pixel during the transformation.

#### Configurations for NIOS II Tested:
* 4K Instruction cache, 4K Data Cache - Floating point
* 4K Instruction cache, 16K Data Cache - Floating point
* 4K Instruction cache, 4K Data Cache - Fixed point
* 4K Instruction cache, 16K Data Cache - Fixed point
