# Project 4 
## Multiprocessor Image Transformation

A second NIOS processor, a second JTAG UART, two mailboxes, and corresponding on-chip memories were added to the configuration of the FPGA. Performance counters were used to measure the performance of rotating an image with two processers versus one.
